The `surf` application computes minimal surfaces with prescribed boundary (the Plateau problem). 

This repository contains the old cpp code in the `cpp` directory and new javascript code in the `js` directory.

See [cpp/README](cpp/README) or [js/README.md](js/README.md) for the respective documentation.

Open [https://paolini.github.io/surf/](https://paolini.github.io/surf/)
